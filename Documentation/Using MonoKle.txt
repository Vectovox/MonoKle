NOTES: MonoKleGame is under development and will change a lot until its first Major release. Do not expect perfect performance, features, or code.

Using MonoKle is as straight forward as installing MonoGame, OpenAL, and referencing the .DLL in your
project.

Some quick pointers:
- To start a game, in program.cs get an instance of MonoKleGame from MonoKleGame.GetInstance() and call run() on it. (Example source will come later).
- Everything runs in states and are added via the MonoKleGame.StateManager. It is possible to have a single state, but it is reasonable to have a state for intro, menu, and game (for instance). When you have added your states (which can be done at run-time as well) you have to set the starting state also.
