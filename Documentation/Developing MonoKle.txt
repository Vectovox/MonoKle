NOTES: MonoKleGame is under development and will change a lot until its first Major release. Do not expect perfect performance, features, or code.

Developing MonoKle is as straight forward as installing MonoGame, OpenAL, and cloning the repository.

For pull requests to the *dev* branch of the main MonoKle repository there are a couple of pointers:
- StyleCop is followed as much as possible.
- Code should be readable and public methods/fields/properties shall be documented.
- Just read some code and you will get a hang of the style! ;)
- Versioning follows x.x.x.x - Major, Minor, feature, fix. Both Major and Minor may break compatibility with existing code.
- Although the architecture may change (especially when introducing new features deprecating old ones), it should be kept the same until otherwise noted.

*Phew*

So yeah, the more minor the contribution (maybe some documentation or bug fixes) the higher the chance of it being accepted instantly.
